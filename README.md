# Welcome to the Dispersion Repo!

Dispersion is a interactive client-side javascript project that treats the cursor as a magnet and repels particles or pixels away from it.

Users can repel the particles by move the cursor near them.

### MVP Features
- [ ] User can interact with the particles and particles respond appropriately (by being repelled)
- [ ] The repelled particles will get back to their initial position after cursor moves away
- [ ] The particles may not enter the cursor's range

#### bonus
- [ ] have the particles be pixels of a photo or a video
- [ ] make the entire model 3d

### Technologies

I will be using vanilla Javascript for the app's code. All the rendering will be done using Canvas. The repulsion and collision will be physics.

### Implementation Timeline

#### Over the weekend

Learn the ins and outs of canvas and get myself comfortable with it.
Think about the physics that will be required for this app.

#### Day 1:

Get the basic configuration done.
Be able to render particles on the page.

#### Day 2:

Get the particles to be aligned to the "grid".
Make the particles repel.

#### Day 3:

Make the particles align themselves to grid.

#### Day 4 & 5: 

Work on the bonus mvps
